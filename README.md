# Integrated Information in Variational Inference
&nbsp;

This repository contains code for calculating integrated information in variational inference. We use a hybrid (i.e., partly numerical, partly analytical) approach to simulate the evolution of Gaussian parameters during variational inference, and use those as inputs for calculating integrated information at each point in the evolution. This work (led by Nadine Spychala & Miguel Aguilera) is ongoing and not yet documented and tested.
